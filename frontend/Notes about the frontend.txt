- There is a bug that checkbox and the text are speart so for that we need to fix it as it is not customzeble right now - class CustomCheckBox.dart
- Still need to checkout the routing in the app.dart, the routing to the other pages. And see how to make it name routing.
- the drawer is not working on the name routing, I need to check that out, for now it only works on the basic Navigator page
- I can add the google animation to the bottom navigation bar

Functionalties to handle in front-end:
- logout icon (popup menu) AccountPage, AccountCard
- the edit icon in the AccountDetailsPage, HeaderAccountCard
- The View all buttom in the AccountDetailsPage, LederOwnedCard
- clicking on the ListTile that will direct you to the ledger book that is pointing to in the AccountDetailsPage, LederOwnedCard
